# Privacy Policy for Philosopher's Companion

**Last Updated: October 22, 2025**

Thank you for using Philosopher's Companion ("the App"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected.

This app is for Android only and uses Google AdMob for ads and Google Play for in-app purchases.

## Information We Collect

We collect information in two ways: data you store locally on your device and data collected automatically by third-party services.

### 1. Data You Store Locally (On-Device)

This information is stored on your device using `AsyncStorage` and is **never sent to us or any third party**.

* **Your Name:** We may optionally ask for your name. This is used **only** to personalize the images you choose to share.
* **App Settings:** We save your preferences, such as your chosen theme, font, and notification settings, on your device.
* **Favorites & Streak:** Your list of favorite quotes and your daily streak are stored locally on your device.

### 2. Data Collected Automatically (Third-Party Services)

We use **Google AdMob** to display advertisements in the free version of the App. AdMob is a Firebase service and may collect data to provide and personalize ads. This includes:

* **App Activity:** Such as ad views, clicks on ads, and other interactions.
* **Device Information:** Including your device model, operating system, and IP address (for approximate location).
* **Device IDs:** Such as your device's Advertising ID.

To better protect your privacy, we have configured AdMob to request **Non-Personalized Ads** wherever possible.

## How We Use Your Information

* **To Provide App Functionality:** We use the data stored locally to save your settings and favorites, as you intended.
* **To Display Advertisements:** We use Google AdMob to show ads that support the free version of the app.
* **To Improve the App:** We use aggregated data from AdMob (like crash reports) to identify bugs and improve app performance.

## In-App Purchases

The App offers a one-time "Pro" upgrade. This purchase is **managed securely and entirely by the Google Play Store**. We **do not** collect or store any of your payment information (like credit card numbers).

When the app starts, it checks with Google Play's services to verify if you have already purchased the "Pro" version and unlocks features accordingly.

## Data Deletion

You have control over your data in the following ways:

1.  **Locally Stored Data:** You can delete your "User Name" at any time by going to the Settings screen in the app and clearing the name field. You can delete all your local data (favorites, settings, streak) by clearing the app's cache or data in your main Android Settings.
2.  **Advertising Data:** You can reset your device's Advertising ID or opt out of personalized advertising by going to your Android Settings > Google > Ads.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

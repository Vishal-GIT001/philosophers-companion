# Privacy Policy for Philosopher's Companion

**Last Updated: August 17, 2025**

Thank you for using Philosopher's Companion ("the App"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect your information. The App is built with Expo and uses services like Google AdMob for ads, Firebase for notifications and authentication, and other Expo modules for functionality.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following data automatically through third-party SDKs:

- **Approximate Location**: Inferred from your IP address (via AdMob) for ad targeting. Not precise.
- **App Activity**: Interactions like ad clicks/views and other actions (e.g., session data, notification opens) via AdMob and Firebase.
- **App Info and Performance**: Crash logs, diagnostics (e.g., load times), and other performance data via Firebase and Expo.
- **Device or Other IDs**: Advertising ID (AdMob), Firebase Installation ID, and device metadata (e.g., OS version, model) via Expo.

We also use Firebase Authentication for an anonymous User ID (not linked to personal info) and Firestore to store purchase status for the "Pro" version.

We do not collect sensitive personal info like name, email, exact location, or contacts unless you provide it (e.g., via support).

## How We Use Your Information

Data is used for:
- App functionality (e.g., notifications, stability via Firebase/Expo).
- Analytics (e.g., performance monitoring).
- Advertising/marketing (e.g., targeted ads via AdMob).
- Fraud prevention/security/compliance (e.g., detecting invalid ad activity).

## Data Sharing

We share data with:
- Google (for Firebase/AdMob services and subprocessors).
- Ad partners (via AdMob) for ad delivery and measurement.

We do not sell data or share for unrelated purposes.

## Data Security

All data is encrypted in transit (using TLS/HTTPS). We follow industry standards for protection, but no system is 100% secure.

## Data Deletion

You can request deletion of your data (e.g., ad ID reset or Firebase records) via this form: [Deletion Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4_zAUBxwietu1U9ejl161eUrcDO-HWQNClCPX5AdplxuKdg/viewform). Some data (e.g., ad IDs) can be managed in Android settings.

## Your Choices

Opt out of personalized ads via Android settings. For other data, collection is required for app features.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with the updated date.
